# Kern County Mines and Localities GPX

A comprehensive GPX waypoint dataset of **600+ mines and mineral localities in Kern County, California**. Waypoints are derived from Mindat strings and geocoded into GPS coordinates, with naming modifiers to distinguish **major confirmed mines** from **approximate or inferred locations**.

This dataset is designed for **offline, WiFi-less use** in remote regions and is compatible with standard GPS devices, mobile apps, and desktop GIS software.

## Author’s Note
This dataset was created for my personal trip through Kern County, California, where my friends and I were camping in remote desert areas with no cell service or WiFi. Having access to an offline GPX file was extremely useful for navigation and trip efficiency. This set has been tried an tested. I hope you enjoy!
